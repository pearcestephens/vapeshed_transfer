## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Well
- Preserving all files in organized ARCHIVE/ subdirectories
- Clear naming: phase_11_12_reports/, status_reports/, implementation_records/
- Removing only outdated duplicates and unrelated files

### Best Practices Going Forward
- Archive completed phase reports immediately after phase completion
- Keep only current status document in root
- Use ARCHIVE/ subdirectories for logical grouping
- Delete obvious duplicates/unrelated files promptly

---

## 🔒 SAFETY NOTES

### What Was Preserved
- **All historical reports** in ARCHIVE/ with clear subdirectories
- **All configuration files** (.env, .env.example, .gitignore)
- **All code directories** (transfer_engine/, bin/, docs/)
- **All version control** (.git/, .github/)

### What Was Deleted
- **Only outdated duplicate** ("docs copy/" missing 20+ newer files)
- **Only unrelated file** (FREIGHT-PACKS.TXT from different project)

### Recovery
If needed, all archived files can be moved back:
```bash
# Example recovery command
mv ARCHIVE/phase_11_12_reports/*.md .
```
