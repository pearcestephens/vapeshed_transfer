Action: Added `ProposalStore`, `RunLogWriter` (stdout placeholders). Extended smoke script with persistence + drift + materialization outputs.
Rollback: Remove `src/Persistence` files + revert smoke script section.
Next: Phase M10 (to be added) - Policy application orchestration stub.

## Consolidation (Phase M10 Policy Orchestrator Skeleton)
Date: 2025-10-03
Action: Added `PolicyOrchestrator` coordinating guardrails + scoring + proposal persistence; smoke script extended with policy result.
Rollback: Remove `src/Policy/PolicyOrchestrator.php` + revert smoke modifications + manifest section.
Next: Future phases will replace placeholder persistence and wire real pricing/transfer contexts.

## Consolidation (Phase M11 Migrations Added)
Date: 2025-10-03
Action: Added migration files for proposal_log, guardrail_traces, insights_log, run_log, config_audit, drift_metrics.
Rollback: Drop tables in reverse dependency order (drift_metrics, config_audit, run_log, insights_log, guardrail_traces, proposal_log).
Next: Phase M12 implement real persistence adapters writing to these tables.

## Consolidation (Phase M12 Persistence Implementation)
Date: 2025-10-03
Action: Added repositories (Proposal, GuardrailTrace, Insight, RunLog, DriftMetrics, Db wrapper); updated ProposalStore & PolicyOrchestrator to begin DB writes (proposal id currently opaque) and extended smoke script wiring.
Rollback: Remove added repository classes; revert PolicyOrchestrator & ProposalStore; optional truncate new tables.
Next: Phase M13 pricing engine skeleton + linking proposal IDs to traces.

## Consolidation (Phase M13 Pricing Skeleton & Trace Linkage)
Date: 2025-10-03
Action: Added Pricing module skeleton (`src/Pricing/{CandidateBuilder,RuleEvaluator,PricingEngine}.php`); modified `ProposalStore` to return inserted ID; updated `PolicyOrchestrator` to persist guardrail traces with real proposal_id; extended smoke script to exercise pricing run producing proposals and trace linkage.
Rollback: Delete `src/Pricing` directory and revert changes to ProposalStore, PolicyOrchestrator, and smoke script (restore prior commit); guardrail_traces rows with proposal_id set remain valid but orphan-safe.
Next: Phase M14 transfer integration refactor + real data sourcing for pricing candidates.

## Consolidation (Phase M14 Transfer Integration Skeleton)
Date: 2025-10-03
Action: Added `src/Transfer/{DsrCalculator,LegacyAdapter,TransferService}.php`; updated smoke script to execute transfer run producing propose-only transfer proposals (type=transfer) through policy pipeline. No schema changes required.
Rollback: Remove `src/Transfer` directory and revert smoke script modifications in `bin/unified_adapter_smoke.php` Phase M14 block.
Next: Phase M15 Matching normalization utilities (brand/token extraction) and integration stub.

## Consolidation (Phase M15 Matching Utilities Skeleton)

Next: Phase M17 insight enrichment linking proposals to drift & demand anomalies.

## Consolidation (Phase M17 Insight Enrichment Snapshot)
Date: 2025-10-03

## Consolidation (Phase M18 Policy Auto-Apply Pilot Placeholder)
Date: 2025-10-03

### Enhancement: Cooloff Infrastructure Groundwork
Date: 2025-10-03
Action: Added migration `20251003_0007_create_cooloff_log.sql`, `CooloffRepository`, wired optional cooloff + config-driven auto-apply gating into `PolicyOrchestrator` and smoke script.

### Enhancement: Config Defaults Extended (Auto-Apply & Cooloff)
Date: 2025-10-03

### Enhancement: Action Audit Infrastructure & Dashboard
Date: 2025-10-03
Action: Added migration `20251003_0008_create_action_audit.sql`, `ActionAuditRepository`, unified dashboard endpoint (`public/unified_dashboard.php`), validation CLI (`bin/validate_system.php`). Updated `PolicyOrchestrator` to record audit entries on auto-apply. Smoke script now wires audit repo.
Rollback: Drop `action_audit` table, remove `ActionAuditRepository.php`, remove `public/unified_dashboard.php`, remove `bin/validate_system.php`, revert `PolicyOrchestrator` & smoke script audit wiring.

### Enhancement: Real Data Sourcing Infrastructure
Date: 2025-10-03
Action: Added crawler components (`src/Crawler/{HttpClient,ProductScraper}.php`), real pricing candidate builder (`src/Pricing/RealCandidateBuilder.php`), test scripts (`bin/test_crawler.php`, `bin/test_url_scrape.php`, `bin/test_real_matching.php`). HttpClient uses Chrome user-agent for scraping; ProductScraper fetches from Google; RealCandidateBuilder queries DB for low-margin products. All tested and functional.
Rollback: Remove `src/Crawler` directory, remove `src/Pricing/RealCandidateBuilder.php`, remove test scripts.
Status: Ready for integration into pricing/transfer candidate generation; currently parallel to static samples.
