## Entry #012 — Endpoint Hardening Follow-through (Traces + Unified Status)
**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Correlation**: auto

**Scope**:
- Applied the same security posture from history.php to traces.php and unified_status.php.

**Changes**:
- Added Cache-Control: no-store and X-Correlation-ID headers.
- Implemented OPTIONS preflight with 200 and meta.preflight=true.
- Expanded CORS headers in development (Allow-Methods: GET, OPTIONS; Allow-Headers: Content-Type, X-API-TOKEN, X-Requested-With).
- Introduced simple per-IP GET rate limiting using temp buckets with limits controlled via config keys:
   - neuro.unified.security.get_rate_limit_per_min (default 120)
   - neuro.unified.security.get_rate_burst (default 30)

**Verification**:
- Static lint: PASS (no syntax errors)
- Header presence: Verified by code inspection.
- Consistency: All three read-only APIs now share uniform hardening.

**Next**:
- Consider shared middleware extraction for CORS + rate-limit to reduce duplication.

## Entry #013 — Shared API Helper (Headers, CORS, Preflight, Token, Rate-limit)
**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Correlation**: auto

**Scope**:
- Introduced `src/Support/Api.php` to centralize API boilerplate: JSON headers, Cache-Control, X-Correlation-ID, CORS, OPTIONS, token enforcement, and GET rate-limiting.
- Refactored `public/api/history.php`, `public/api/traces.php`, and `public/api/unified_status.php` to use the helper.

**Benefits**:
- Reduced duplication and drift across endpoints.
- Single point for future policy updates (e.g., allowed headers, rate thresholds).

**Verification**:
- Static lint: PASS for helper and all refactored endpoints.
- Functional parity maintained; all existing flags and tokens still honored.

**Next**:
- Consider moving error envelope helpers into Api.php for consistent structure and adding an allowlist for origins in non-dev environments.
