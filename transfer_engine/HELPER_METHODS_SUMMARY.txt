━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 HELPER METHODS IMPLEMENTED

Method #1: Database::getPoolStats()
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Type: Static method (no instance required)
Returns: Array with 7 metrics
Purpose: Monitor connection pool performance

Metrics Provided:
  • pool_size - Number of connections in pool
  • active_connections - Currently active connections
  • total_connections - Total created since start
  • failed_connections - Failed connection attempts
  • reconnects - Reconnection attempts
  • queries_executed - Total queries executed
  • pool_keys - Connection identifiers

Usage:
  $stats = Database::getPoolStats();
  echo "Active: {$stats['active_connections']}\n";

Method #2: Database::closeAllConnections()
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Type: Static method (no instance required)
Returns: Integer (number of connections closed)
Purpose: Clean shutdown and testing teardown

Features:
  • Closes all active MySQL connections
  • Clears connection pool
  • Resets singleton instance
  • Resets metrics counters
  • Logs closure count
  • Auto-reconnect on next operation

Usage:
  $closed = Database::closeAllConnections();
  echo "Closed {$closed} connection(s)\n";

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🧪 TESTS ACTIVATED (4 tests)

Before Implementation:
  Total: 56 tests
  Passing: 45 (80.4%)
  Incomplete: 11 (19.6%)
  Failures: 0

After Implementation (Expected):
  Total: 56 tests
  Passing: 49 (87.5%) ⬆️
  Incomplete: 7 (12.5%) ⬇️
  Failures: 0

Tests Now Active:
  ✅ Performance::testConnectionPoolUnderLoad
  ✅ Integration::testDatabaseConnectionPooling
  ✅ Chaos::testDatabaseConnectionRecovery
  ✅ Chaos::testResourceCleanupAfterErrors

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚀 HOW TO TEST

Step 1: Quick Verification (30 seconds)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Test just the helper methods before running full suite:

  clear && bash bin/quick_test_helpers.sh

This runs 9 test scenarios:
  1. Get initial pool stats (empty)
  2. Create connection
  3. Get stats after connection
  4. Execute queries
  5. Get stats after queries
  6. Close all connections
  7. Get stats after close (should be empty)
  8. Test auto-reconnect
  9. Get final stats

Expected: All ✓ with proper metrics

Step 2: Full Test Suite (2-3 seconds)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Run complete 56-test suite:

  clear && bash bin/run_advanced_tests.sh

Expected Results:
  ✅ Basic: 10/10 (100%)
  ✅ Security: 16/16 (100%)
  ✅ Performance: 8/8 (100%) - NOW INCLUDING POOL TEST
  ✅ Integration: 8/11 (73%) - NOW INCLUDING POOLING TEST
  ✅ Chaos: 7/11 (64%) - NOW INCLUDING RECOVERY & CLEANUP

  Overall: 49/56 PASSING (87.5%) ⬆️ from 80.4%

Step 3: Combined Test (Recommended)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Verify helpers then run full suite:

  clear && bash bin/test_with_helpers.sh

This does both steps automatically.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
