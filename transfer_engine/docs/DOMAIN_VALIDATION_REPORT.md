# Domain Module Validation Report
Date: 2025-10-04
Component: Transfer & Pricing Engines
Mode: Implementation Analysis & Validation

## Transfer Engine (src/Transfer)
- DsrCalculator.php: Correctly computes DSR and projects post-transfer DSRs; clamps negative stock.
- LegacyAdapter.php: Provides normalized candidates; placeholder static data with logging.
- TransferService.php: Iterates candidates → projects DSR → maps features → delegates to PolicyOrchestrator; returns structured results with run_id.
- Verdict: Ready for integration; propose-only behavior as expected. No side-effects.

## Pricing Engine (src/Pricing)
- CandidateBuilder.php: Static sample candidates with realistic fields (cost, ROI, DSR). Logging included.
- RuleEvaluator.php: Computes margin uplift, competitor alignment, and risk penalty; logs meta.
- PricingEngine.php: Maps features, delegates to PolicyOrchestrator; consistent return format.
- Verdict: Ready for propose-only cycles; feature mapping is clear and extendable.

## API Surfaces
- public/api/transfer.php: Status/queue/calculate/execute endpoints; now environment-aware CORS; RBAC/CSRF/rate limiting toggles.
- public/api/pricing.php: Status/candidates/scan/apply/toggle_auto/rules; environment-aware CORS; RBAC/CSRF/rate limiting toggles.

## SSE & Health
- public/sse.php: Hardened; bounded lifetime; topic filters; fixed Config environment read.
- public/health.php & health_sse.php: Present; JSON responses; basic slot counting for SSE locks.

## Security & Ops
- Smoke summary API: Optional token support; disabled by default; CORS gated by environment.
- Removed hard-coded DB credentials in simple_validation.php.

## Status
- Engines and APIs: GREEN
- Risks: None critical; candidates are static placeholders by design until real data wiring (future phase).
