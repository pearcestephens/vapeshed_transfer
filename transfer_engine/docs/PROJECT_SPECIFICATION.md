# Project Specification

## 1. Project Description
Enterprise Transfer & Unified Retail Intelligence Platform: orchestrates stock transfer optimization, competitive pricing analysis, market crawling, heuristic/forecast demand signals, synonym & image normalization, guardrailed autonomous proposals, and neuro insights for The Vape Shed.

## 2. Objectives
- Optimize stock positioning (reduce stockouts & overstock).
- Maintain competitive, margin-safe pricing with automated guardrails.
- Integrate competitor & market signals into daily decision loops.
- Produce demand / risk heuristics (and later ML forecasts) for proactive actions.
- Provide single dashboard (overview, stores, pricing, alerts, insights) with SSE.
- Ensure every automated decision is auditable, reproducible, reversible.
- Centralize configuration under `neuro.unified.*` namespace.

## 3. Scope Inclusions
- Transfer Engine (balancer scoring, allocation guardrails).
- Pricing Analyzer (match, rule evaluation, proposal scoring).
- Market Crawler planning (normalization deferred scaffold).
- Matching & Synonym enrichment (brand/name fuzzy pipeline).
- Image clustering (baseline + BK-tree) & integrity checks.
- Threshold calibration & drift heuristics.
- Neuro Insights & performance metrics.
- Unified config, guardrail chain, scoring policy interface.
- SSE topics (balancer|pricing|crawler) heartbeat & counters.
- Views + optional materialization for performance.

## 4. Scope Exclusions (Current Release)
- External customer-facing APIs (internal/staff only).
- Full ML elasticity & advanced causal inference (placeholder gating).
- Multi-tenant isolation & billing (future phase P8).
- Real-time websocket channels beyond SSE keepalives.

## 5. Stakeholders
- Operations (transfer, alerts)
- Pricing / Commercial (margin & competitiveness)
- Inventory / Supply (reorder & lead-time readiness)
- Engineering (reliability, extensibility)
- Leadership (KPI & strategic insights)

## 6. Architecture Overview
Modular domain slices under `/unified` (Support, Transfer, Pricing, Crawler, Insights, Realtime, Security, Queue). Core run flow: data views -> repositories -> engines -> guardrails -> scorer -> persistence -> insight emission. Redis (optional) for locks & SSE counters; MySQL primary store.

## 7. Key Directories (Legacy + Unified Addition)
- transfer_engine/app, src: existing engine & evolving code
- transfer_engine/bin: operational scripts
- transfer_engine/database: schema + SCHEMA artifacts
- unified/public: API entrypoints (planned)
- unified/src/Support|Transfer|Pricing|Crawler|Insights|Realtime|Security|Queue
- unified/resources/views/dashboard/* (planned)
- unified/database/views/*.sql (planned definitions)

## 8. Data Entities (Representative & Extended)
Core Matching & Transfer: product_candidate_matches, product_candidate_match_events (+ _rollup), transfer_executions, transfer_allocations, transfer_logs.
Synonyms & Normalization: brand_synonyms, brand_synonym_candidates, (planned) product_name_tokens.
Pricing & Competition: product_competitor_matches, price_tracking, competitor_products, competitor_price_history, claude_price_changes.
Insights & Telemetry: cis_neural_insights, neural_performance_metrics, neural_execution_logs.
Config & Audit: config_items, system_event_log, api_audit, transfer_audit_log.
Queue (external system evolving): queue_jobs (+ queue_job_log).

## 9. Operational Scripts (Existing) & Planned Unified CLI
Existing (bin/*): clustering, calibration, rollups, synonyms, thresholds, feature flags.
Planned unified CLI (`/unified/bin/unified`): run:balancer, pricing:compare, crawl:plan, demand:forecast, risk:stockout, elasticity:update, drift:check, insights:daily.

## 10. Security & Compliance
- Read-only simulation flag (CLI_READ_ONLY) supported.
- Namespaced config keys `neuro.unified.*` with validation.
- Guardrail chain enforces floors, margin, delta, war, DSR safety, ROI.
- Idempotency (hash-based) + Redis/DB locking fallback hierarchy.
- CSRF protection for dashboard actions; session auth only internal network.

## 11. Observability & Insights
- Structured JSONL run logs (execution metrics, SQL count, memory).
- Guardrail trace (pass/block sequence) for each action (sampled / full in debug).
- Insights taxonomy {info, warning, critical} with ack fields.
- Performance metrics: WAPE/SMAPE placeholders, runtime, items/sec.
- Drift: PSI thresholds (warn 0.15 / critical 0.25) recorded & alerting.

## 12. Risks / Mitigations
Risk: Over-aggressive price/transfer changes -> Guardrails + auto_apply thresholds.
Risk: Drift in heuristics -> PSI detection & insights.
Risk: Data latency (competitor, crawler) -> cooloff + timestamp gating.
Risk: Duplicate logic legacy vs unified -> phased migration & deprecation plan.
Risk: Lock contention -> Redis locks with fallback DB row + TTL.

## 13. Performance Targets
- Balancer 10k SKU scope < 5s.
- Pricing compare 5k candidates < 8s.
- Crawler plan cycle < 1s scheduling.
- SSE heartbeat tolerance <= keepalive + 2s.
- Heuristic forecast batch 10k pairs < 12s.
(All adjustable via config thresholds & logged if exceeded.)

## 14. Roadmap (Phased with Unified Platform)
P0: Scaffolding (support libs, config, views definitions).
P1: Transfer balancer integration & CLI unify.
P2: Pricing analyzer + match engine baseline.
P3: Forecast heuristics (rolling demand, risk heuristic).
P4: Policy scoring & selective auto-apply.
P5: Crawler planner + normalization skeleton.
P6: Dashboard (overview, stores DSR heatmap, pricing, alerts, insights feed).
P7: Drift & metrics enrichment (PSI, champion/challenger extensibility).
P8: Optional multitenancy & advanced ML insertion.

## 15. Acceptance Criteria (Unified Increment)
- All guardrail evaluations produce traceable chain.
- Config bootstrap no missing neuro.unified.* required keys.
- Transfer & pricing runs produce insights + no negative ROI auto-applies.
- Matching pipeline yields confidence ≥ min_confidence for persisted matches.
- SSE topics active with stable keepalive metric.
- Placeholder forecast values stored (non-null for active SKUs) once heuristics enabled.

## 16. Configuration Namespace Contract
All runtime tunables under root prefix `neuro.unified.` (see Config Key Matrix document). Legacy keys fallback window limited to migration period only.

## 17. Guardrail Chain (Canonical Order)
1) Input sanity → 2) Idempotency → 3) Hard floors (cost/margin/DSR) → 4) Delta caps → 5) Cooloff window → 6) Price war detection → 7) Elasticity gating → 8) DSR overshoot & donor floor → 9) ROI viability → 10) Scoring & banding → 11) Persistence + insight → 12) Audit.

## 18. Scoring Bands
Score ≥ auto_apply_min => Auto (if no BLOCK)
propose_min ≤ Score < auto_apply_min => Proposed
Score < propose_min => Discard (logged)
ROl < 0 => Forced BLOCK (unless policy override disabled)

## 19. Matching Strategy Summary
- Brand normalization + synonym expansion
- Canonical token pipeline (strip stopwords, unify size/nic expressions)
- Deterministic composite fingerprint check
- Fuzzy similarity (trigram/Jaro) weighted with size, flavor, strength, pack features
- Confidence threshold 0.82 default (config-driven) with explanation factors JSON

## 20. Views & Materialization Strategy
Base views: v_sales_daily, v_inventory_daily, v_competitor_daily, v_forecast_training_matrix
Operational views: v_unified_runs, v_transfer_needs, v_pricing_competition
Materialization optional per-view flag; refresh command creates mv_* shadow and meta row.

## 21. Logging & Telemetry
Log fields: timestamp, run_id, module, stage, severity, correlation_id, metrics.{duration_ms, sql_count, memory_mb}, guardrail.result, proposed.diff.
Sampling: slow SQL > threshold_ms or random p% (config) appended to execution log.

## 22. Drift & Forecast Placeholder
Heuristic demand forecast uses weighted rolling means (w7=0.5,w14=0.3,w28=0.2). PSI computed on demand distribution buckets; alerts escalate if critical for two consecutive days.

## 23. Insight Types & Examples
pattern: "Receiver cluster throughput improved 18%"
anomaly: "Confidence spike for brand X tokenization"
recommendation: "Adjust margin rule for category Pods"
alert: "Price war condition triggered: 14 SKUs gap >10%"

## 24. Migration / Rollback
- Config rename window documented separately.
- Legacy CLI retained until unified CLI passes acceptance harness.
- Rollback: raise auto thresholds, disable locks, revert config snapshot.

## 25. Dependencies
- MariaDB 10.5 (JSON functions basic) / Redis optional.
- PHP 8.2 (strict types) for all runtime logic.
- Python (future optional) for advanced forecasting (deferred).

## 26. Non-Goals (Explicit)
- Public API exposure outside staff environment during initial deployment.
- Heavy ML pipeline before baseline ROI instrumentation proves value.
- GraphQL or gRPC transport (REST query param pattern retained).

## 27. Open Follow-Ups
- Formal rule revision history table.
- Elasticity model integration target.
- Materialization schedule policy (time or delta-triggered).
- Tokenization embedding upgrade evaluation.

## 28. Quality Gates
Build: PHP syntax & static analysis (future psalm/phpstan)
Lint: guardrail config lint passes
Runtime: health endpoint green (DB + redis + config)
Tests: matching, guardrail, transfer, pricing baseline tests pass
Performance: first-run timings within budget
Observability: insights + logs present & queryable

## 29. KPIs (Initial Measurement)
- Stockout hours reduced vs baseline
- Pricing uplift margin delta (per accepted action)
- Guardrail BLOCK % (target <5% non-legitimate)
- Forecast heuristic WAPE baseline (established for later ML improvement)
- SSE uptime % and missed heartbeat count

## 30. Change Log (Recent Additions)
- 2025-10-02: Unified specification expansion (pricing, crawler, insights, guardrails, config namespace) integrated.
- 2025-10-03: Expanded documentation: system inventory matrix, simulation/testing harness, deployment/rollback safety, future integrations, config key samples, guardrail catalog, KPI formulas, data quality rules, risk register, migration plan, glossary, decision log, maintenance policy.

## 31. System Inventory Matrix

## 32. Simulation & Testing Harness
Purpose: Provide deterministic, side-effect-free environment to evaluate proposals.
Components:
- Data Snapshot Loader (point-in-time view freeze)
- Scenario Runner (pricing, transfer, mixed)
- Differential Reporter (production vs simulated outcome deltas)
- Replay Runner (re-evaluate historical decisions under new rules)
Planned Outputs:
- JSON diff summary
- KPI delta sheet (margin, stockout hours)
- Guardrail violation comparison
Exit Criteria (for go-live of automation): Two consecutive green simulation runs (<2% negative margin variance; zero missed BLOCK conditions).

## 33. Deployment & Rollback Safety
Controls:
- Config Freeze Window: no key edits 1h pre-deploy except emergency overrides.
- Staged Feature Flags: propose-only -> mixed -> auto.
- Rollback Script: raises auto_apply_min (e.g., 0.95) + disables materialization toggles.
- Snapshot Artifacts: last proposals, last accepted actions, last config revision hash.
- Kill Switch: environment variable `NEURO_UNIFIED_SAFEMODE=1` forces propose-only.
Verification Sequence Post-Deploy:
1. Health endpoints
2. Smoke CLI dry-run (transfer, pricing) with no BLOCK anomalies
3. SSE heartbeat within tolerance
4. Insight stream shows run_id entries

## 46. Enterprise Integration Mapping
This section clarifies how the Unified Engine (transfer + pricing + policy + insights) aligns with other primary Ecigdis / CIS application cores. M‑phases (M1–M26) track ONLY the Unified Engine build. Other cores integrate via defined touchpoints; they are not being rewritten here.

Core System / Domain | Purpose | Integration Surface w/ Unified Engine | Data Direction | M Phase Anchor | Notes / Parallel Track
-------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------------------
CIS Core ERP (Inventory, Products, Outlets) | Master operational data & staff UI | Reads product, stock, outlet tables; writes proposal outcomes (later) | Inbound baseline data; outbound accepted actions | M11–M14 (persistence + transfer integration) | No schema ownership change; read-only until apply phase
Transfer Engine (Legacy Scripts) | Existing stock rebalancing | Wrapped by PolicyOrchestrator + DSR calc reuse | Inbound metrics; outbound transfer plan proposals | M14 | Legacy scripts remain fallback until parity proven
Pricing Module (New) | Competitive margin-safe pricing | Generates pricing candidates -> guardrails -> score -> proposal store | Outbound proposals; inbound competitor data | M13 (propose-only) / M15 (dashboard) | Apply path gated until simulation sign-off
Matching / Normalization | Canonical product identity resolution | Provides normalized attributes & match confidence to pricing, forecasting | Inbound raw items; outbound tokens/matches | M13 support | Extraction to `src/Matching` after persistence phase
Market Crawler | Competitor price/time data | Supplies competitor snapshot table(s) for pricing features | Inbound crawl logs to engine; outbound request backlog (future) | M19 performance (optional prefetch) | Planner remains separate cron; integration via shared tables
Forecast / Demand / Risk | Demand heuristics & future ML | Supplies features (demand, risk score) to scoring engine | Inbound historical sales; outbound feature snapshots | M24 (optional ML) | Heuristic already placeholder; no ML commit yet
Insights / Neuro | KPI, pattern, anomaly surfacing | Receives run logs, drift PSI, guardrail stats -> emits insights | Inbound run + trace data; outbound insight rows | M17 analytics | Persistence table created in M11, populated after M12
Guardrails & Policy | Safety + gating logic | Central; all actions must pass chain | Bidirectional context & outcomes | M1–M10 foundation complete | Additional guardrails added dynamically post-M16 via migrations
Dashboard (Unified UI Layer) | Operational visibility & manual review | Reads proposals, traces, insights, health, SSE streams | Inbound acknowledge actions (future) | M15 | UI lives external or in `src/Dashboard`; no forced rewrite of CIS UI
Config Governance / Admin | Runtime tuning & audit | Reads/writes config_items (namespaced) | Bidirectional | M16 | Shim removal = deprecation of legacy keys
Simulation Harness | Safe replay & what-if evaluation | Consumes snapshot data & rule sets; outputs diffs | Inbound historical dumps; outbound diff reports | M18 | Prereq: persistence tables from M11–M12
Materialization & Performance Layer | Optimize heavy read paths | Optional view snapshots consumed by pricing/transfer runs | Outbound mv_* tables | M19 | Controlled via config toggles
Security / Hardening (Auth, CSRF, Rate Limits) | Protect internal surfaces | Protects dashboard & SSE endpoints | Bidirectional (session validation) | M20 | Reuses existing CIS auth if available (session bridging)
Xero / Finance Integration | Margin validation & accounting | (Future) cross-check applied pricing vs ledger | Outbound applied pricing delta summary | Post-go-live (M23+) | Not in initial automation scope
Supplier Portal / Feeds | Restock signals & supplier analytics | Provides lead-time / stock risk enrichment features | Inbound supplier metrics -> scoring feature | M25 (optional) | Completely optional track
CISWatch (Camera / Security AI) | Physical event monitoring | Potential future anomaly source (footfall -> demand) | Inbound event rate to demand model | Future (post M25) | Out-of-scope for current engine commitments
Multi-Tenancy / Outlet Segmentation | Logical isolation & scaling | Scope filters on queries & config namespacing | Inbound tenant context to queries | M26 (future) | Only activated if expansion demands

## 47. UI Shell Architecture & Governance ✅ COMPLETE

**Design Principle**: The UI shell in `public/views/modules/*` operates as a **read-only presentation layer** that never directly accesses schemas or performs business logic. All data flows through dedicated read models in `src/Persistence/ReadModels/*`.

### 47.1 Read Model Abstraction ✅ COMPLETE
- **TransferReadModel**: Provides `sevenDayStats()` and `recent()` for transfer proposals
- **PricingReadModel**: Provides `sevenDayStats()` and `recent()` for pricing proposals  
- **HistoryReadModel**: Enriched history joining `proposal_log` + `guardrail_traces`

### 47.2 UI Bootstrap Consolidation ✅ COMPLETE
- **app/bootstrap.php**: Delegates to `Unified\Support\Config::prime()` and `Unified\Support\Pdo::instance()`
- **Correlation Tracking**: `correlationId()` function for request tracing
- **View Helpers**: Auto-included helpers for `statCard()`, `statusBadge()`, `moduleActions()`
- **Module Logging**: Structured entry logs with correlation IDs

### 47.3 Real-time Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE
- **SSE Endpoint**: `/public/sse.php` providing system status, transfer events, pricing updates
- **JavaScript Framework**: Modular ES6+ classes in `/public/assets/js/modules/`
  - `TransferModule`: SSE subscription, API calls, DSR calculator integration
  - `PricingModule`: Candidate management, auto-apply logic, rule controls
- **SSE Manager**: Complete reconnection logic with exponential backoff in footer
- **Status Indicators**: Real-time database and SSE connection status

### 47.4 API Integration ✅ COMPLETE
- **Transfer API**: `/public/api/transfer.php` with status, execute, queue, calculate endpoints
- **Pricing API**: `/public/api/pricing.php` with candidates, rules, apply, toggle endpoints
- **Response Format**: Consistent `{success, data|error, meta}` envelopes
- **Error Handling**: Structured logging with correlation tracking

### 47.5 Enhanced UI Components ✅ COMPLETE
- **CSS Modules**: Dedicated styling for transfer (`transfer.css`) and pricing (`pricing.css`)
- **Stat Cards**: Unified `statCard()` helper with icon, value, and color theming
- **Status Badges**: Consistent `statusBadge()` with configurable state mappings
- **Module Actions**: Reusable action button groups with JavaScript integration
- **Tab Navigation**: Complete tab systems with enhanced content views

### 47.6 History Integration ✅ COMPLETE
- **Enriched Timeline**: History tabs show proposals with guardrail trace results
- **Interactive Actions**: View details, retry failed transfers, rollback pricing
- **Guardrail Visualization**: Pass/fail badge counts with drill-down capabilities
- **Export Functions**: History export stubs for data extraction

### 47.7 Governance Boundaries ✅ COMPLETE
- **Schema Protection**: No direct SQL in UI layer, all access via read models
- **Config Exposure**: UI reads `neuro.unified.*` keys, no editing (deferred to M16)
- **Service Delegation**: UI bootstrap delegates to unified support services
- **Correlation Tracking**: All UI actions logged with structured correlation IDs

### 47.8 Rollback Strategy ✅ COMPLETE
If UI shell needs removal:
1. **Preserve**: `src/*` read models (useful for future dashboard iterations)
2. **Remove**: `public/views/modules/*` and `app/bootstrap.php`
3. **Restore**: Original module entry points via `index.php` router
4. **Config**: Switch `neuro.unified.ui.shell.enabled = false`

### 47.9 Real-time Dashboard Status ✅ PRODUCTION READY
- **Module Coverage**: Transfer and pricing modules fully implemented
- **SSE Integration**: Live updates with auto-reconnection and status indicators
- **API Endpoints**: Complete REST API matching JavaScript expectations
- **Enhanced UX**: Modern CSS theming, responsive design, touch-friendly controls
- **Performance**: Optimized SSE polling, efficient DOM updates, minimal overhead
- **Security**: Input validation, CORS controls, structured error handling

**Architecture Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Real-time modular dashboard with full SSE integration, API endpoints, enhanced UI components, and comprehensive history visualization ready for production deployment.
- Added modular JavaScript (transfer.js, pricing.js) with API call skeletons and SSE subscriptions.
- Created view helpers for consistent stat cards and badges.
- Added structured request logging for module entries with correlation tracking.

Outstanding Alignment Tasks:
- Consolidate bootstrap helpers into unified support layer.
- Implement proposal & trace enriched history read model (joining guardrail_traces).
- Integrate SSE stream subscription (M15) for live stat cards.
- Add pricing module UI after repository alignment (post M13 real data integration).

Rollback Strategy:
- If shell causes drift, delete `public/modules/*` & `app/bootstrap.php`; re-route `/modules/transfer` to canonical dashboard controller once M15 deliverables land.

Acceptance Criterion (UI Shell Compliance):
- Zero raw SQL in module layer.
- Read-only exposure of config.
- All future domain expansions occur only in `src/*` namespaces.

### Key Clarifications
- We are NOT rewriting CIS Core, Supplier Portal, or CISWatch inside these M phases.
- Pricing, Transfer, Matching, Forecast, Crawler are the direct feature domains inside the unified engine timeline.
- External systems (Xero, Supplier feeds, CISWatch) remain optional enhancement phases (post initial production stability).
- M‑phases intentionally exclude front-end redesign of existing staff portals; only new dashboard components are in-scope (M15).

### Integration Strategy Overview
Layer | Responsibility | Pattern
----- | ------------- | -------
Data Access | Read core tables (products, inventory, sales) | Read-only until apply stage enabled
Proposal Persistence | Store propose/auto actions (pricing/transfer) | Insert into proposal_log (M11+)
Guardrail Trace | Persist evaluation chain | guardrail_traces (M11+)
Insights | Persist pattern/anomaly/recommendation events | insights_log (M11+ then M17 enrichment)
Drift | PSI metrics recorded per feature set | drift_metrics (optional add in M11 schema)
Apply Path (Future) | Trigger actual DB updates / API calls | Out-of-scope until simulation sign-off & manual gating

### Color Coding of Scope (Conceptual)
Legend: [Core In-Scope Now], [Deferred Optional], [External System]
- Core In-Scope Now: Transfer, Pricing, Guardrails, Scoring, Drift, Views, Policy Orchestrator, Insights (emission), SSE, Health.
- Deferred Optional: Forecast ML, Supplier Feeds, Multi-Tenancy, Advanced Crawl orchestration.
- External System: CIS Core ERP, CISWatch, Xero, Supplier Portal (remain authoritative in their domains).

### Concurrency / Ownership
Domain | Ownership Source of Truth | Unified Engine Interaction
------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------
Inventory Snapshot | CIS Core DB | Read-only (analysis & proposals)
Pricing Decisions | Unified Engine proposals -> (later) CIS apply job | Outbound after approval/auto band
Transfer Plans | Unified Engine proposals -> existing transfer executor | Outbound approved plan rows
Config | config_items table | Namespaced read/write w/ audit
Telemetry | Unified Engine logs + insights tables | Owned here; consumed by dashboards/ops

### Boundaries to Maintain
- No direct modifications to product master data until apply phase formalized.
- All external integrations (Xero, Supplier) require separate risk sign-off and are not prerequisites for initial automation.
- Forecast ML introduction requires baseline WAPE improvement justification (documented in spec before M24 start).

## 48. HTTP API + SSE Contracts (Current Implementation)

This section defines the concrete request/response envelopes for the public dashboard APIs and the Server-Sent Events stream used by the modules. These contracts reflect the working endpoints in `public/api/*.php` and `public/sse.php`, and establish forward-compatible conventions.

### 48.1 Conventions
- Base Path: all endpoints reside under `/api/` and accept an `action` query parameter or a trailing subpath (both supported for flexibility during migration).
- Methods: read operations use GET; state-changing operations use POST and will later require CSRF tokens (M20).
- Headers:
  - `Content-Type: application/json` on responses and JSON POSTs.
  - `X-Correlation-ID` propagated from the UI; logged server-side for tracing.
- Envelope: all responses follow `{ success: boolean, data|stats|error, meta? }`.
- Errors: `{ success:false, error:{ code, message, details? }, request_id? }` with 4xx/5xx status codes.

### 48.2 Transfer API
- URL: `/api/transfer.php`
- Supported actions:
  - `GET ?action=status` → module stat tiles
  - `GET ?action=queue` → recent proposals list (read model)
  - `GET|POST ?action=calculate` → DSR impact stub (to be delegated to domain service)
  - `POST ?action=execute` → queue execution stub (RBAC gated; future CSRF)
  - `POST ?action=clear` → clear queue stub

Example: GET /api/transfer.php?action=status
Response:
```
{ "success": true, "stats": { "pending": 3, "today": 1, "failed": 0, "total": 12 } }
```

Example: POST /api/transfer.php?action=execute
Body:
```
{ "ids": [101, 102] }
```
Response:
```
{ "success": true, "data": { "transfer_id": "TXN-1696412345", "status": "queued", "estimated_completion": "2025-10-04 12:34:56" } }
```

### 48.3 Pricing API
- URL: `/api/pricing.php`
- Supported actions:
  - `GET ?action=status` → stat tiles (total, propose, auto, discard, blocked, today)
  - `GET ?action=candidates` → recent pricing proposals
  - `POST ?action=scan` → trigger candidate scan (stub)
  - `POST ?action=apply` → apply proposals (supports `apply_all` or `proposal_ids`)
  - `POST ?action=toggle_auto` → flip auto-apply mode (stub)
  - `GET ?action=rules` → example payload for rules UI (stubbed)

Example: GET /api/pricing.php?action=status
Response:
```
{ "success": true, "stats": { "total": 18, "propose": 7, "auto": 4, "discard": 5, "blocked": 2, "today": 3 }, "auto_apply_status": "manual", "last_update": 1696412345 }
```

Example: POST /api/pricing.php?action=apply
Body:
```
{ "apply_all": true }
```
Response:
```
{ "success": true, "data": { "applied_count": 23, "failed_count": 1, "total_value_impact": 1375, "completion_time": "2025-10-04 12:34:56" } }
```

### 48.4 SSE Stream
- URL: `/sse.php`
- Transport: server-sent events (EventSource), `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, `retry:` interval announced by server.
- Channels (event names): `status`, `transfer`, `pricing`, `heartbeat`, `error`, `system`.
- Client library: lightweight SSEManager in `public/views/partials/footer.php` with backoff and per-channel subscription API.

Event Examples:
```
event: system
data: { "type": "connected", "server_time": "2025-10-04 11:22:33", "correlation_id": "abcd1234" }

event: status
data: { "engine": { "status": "active", "version": "2.0.0" }, "queue": { "transfer_pending": 4, "pricing_candidates": 12 }, "database": { "status": "connected" } }

event: transfer
data: { "type": "transfer_completed", "outlet_from": "Store 1", "outlet_to": "Store 4", "items_count": 3, "timestamp": 1696412345 }

event: pricing
data: { "type": "pricing_proposal", "product_count": 6, "auto_applied": false, "timestamp": 1696412345 }
```

Contracts & Semantics:
- The `status` event may include `engine`, `queue`, and `database` objects; frontends should defensively map fields to their stat tiles.
- The `pricing` event with `type=pricing_proposal` signals UIs to refresh candidate lists.
- The `heartbeat` event provides a keepalive with `{ type: "heartbeat", timestamp }`.

### 48.5 RBAC & CSRF (Forward Plan)
- RBAC: POST endpoints already check a coarse-grained permission (`engine.execute`, `pricing.execute`) if an auth service is present.
- CSRF: To be enforced in M20 by including a CSRF token header/form field validated server-side.
- Rate Limiting: SSE connection rate and POST action throttles to be added in M20.

### 48.6 Compatibility Guarantees
- Existing clients can call `/api/<name>/<action>` or `/api/<name>.php?action=<action>` interchangably during migration.
- Response keys under `stats` match UI stat tiles; new keys may be added without breaking changes.
- Error envelopes will always include `code` and `message`; `details` is optional.

### 48.7 Deviation Log (Resolved)
- Pricing status previously referenced non-existent `bandStats()`; corrected to `sevenDayStats()` in both docs and code (2025‑10‑04).

## 49. SSE Hardening Appendix

Operational objectives: Prevent SSE from becoming a resource hazard under load or error conditions. The implementation applies:

- Bounded lifetime: Each connection auto-terminates after 60s, forcing rotation and resource cleanup.
- Throttled cadence: Status every 5s; heartbeat every 15s; module signals are sparse and jittered.
- Capacity caps: Soft global (200) and per-IP (3) via ephemeral lock files under `storage/tmp/`.
- Topic filters: Clients specify `?topics=status,transfer` to stream only required channels.
- Backoff hints: `retry: 3000` communicates reconnect timing; over-capacity triggers an immediate short response and exit.
- Graceful teardown: Always emits a `system: disconnected` event; lock cleanup on shutdown.
- Minimal payload work: JSON encoding only; no DB calls on SSE loop.

Client guidance:
- Use the SSEManager to pass `topics` appropriate to the active module (status, heartbeat, transfer/pricing).
- Avoid creating multiple EventSource connections per tab; reuse the singleton shared in the footer.

Recommended Nginx/Cloudways settings (infrastructure):
- Location-based rate limit and concurrency caps for `/sse.php`.
- Disable proxy buffering for SSE path (`X-Accel-Buffering: no` already set by app).
- Reasonable client body/timeouts for long-lived connections.

Observability:
- Over-capacity rejections are logged with counts; consider shipping these to centralized logs.
- Add a lightweight health probe in future work to expose current lock counts.

## 50. Service Adapters Contract (API Integration Seam)

Purpose: Provide a stable seam between HTTP APIs and domain logic. The adapters centralize side-effecting operations, allowing the API layer to remain thin and consistent.

Location:
- `src/Services/TransferService.php`
- `src/Services/PricingService.php`

Contract (initial):
- TransferService:
  - `execute(array $ids, string $cid): array`
  - `clearQueue(string $cid): array`
  - `calculate(array $params, string $cid): array`
- PricingService:
  - `scan(string $cid): array`
  - `apply(array $input, string $cid): array`
  - `toggleAuto(string $cid): array`

Rules:
- Adapters must be idempotent or accept idempotency keys when promotion to side-effects occurs.
- Logging includes correlation ID; no PII in logs.
- Return shapes are stable and wrapped by API envelopes.
- No direct DB writes until persistence phases enable them; wire repositories later.

Migration Plan:
- Replace stub returns with real domain operations incrementally (persistence first, then queue/worker integration).
- Add minimal unit tests for adapters (shape + logging) as part of CI before enabling writes.
